It was full as heavy and as long as this seven Christmas Eves ago. You have laboured on it since. It is a ponderous chain!”\\n\\nScrooge glanced about him on the floor, in the expectation of finding himself surrounded by some fifty or sixty fathoms of iron cable; but he could see nothing.\\n\\n“Jacob!” he said imploringly. “Old Jacob Marley, tell me more! Speak comfort to me, Jacob!”\\n\\n“I have none to give,” the Ghost replied. “It comes from other regions, Ebenezer Scrooge, and is conveyed by other ministers, to other kinds of men. Nor can I tell you what I would. A very little more is all permitted to me. I cannot rest, I cannot stay, I cannot linger anywhere. My spirit never walked beyond our counting house\\ufeff—mark me;\\ufeff—in life my spirit never roved beyond the narrow limits of our money-changing hole; and weary journeys lie before me!”', '“These are but shadows of the things that have been,” said the Ghost. “They have no consciousness of us.”\\n\\nThe jocund travellers came on; and as they came, Scrooge knew and named them every one. Why was he rejoiced beyond all bounds to see them? Why did his cold eye glisten, and his heart leap up as they went past? Why was he filled with gladness when he heard them give each other Merry Christmas, as they parted at crossroads and byways for their several homes? What was merry Christmas to Scrooge? Out upon merry Christmas! What good had it ever done to him?\\n\\n“The school is not quite deserted,” said the Ghost. “A solitary child, neglected by his friends, is left there still.”\\n\\nScrooge said he knew it. And he sobbed.', 'Scrooge followed to the window: desperate in his curiosity. He looked out.\\n\\nThe air was filled with phantoms, wandering hither and thither in restless haste, and moaning as they went. Every one of them wore chains like Marley’s Ghost; some few (they might be guilty governments) were linked together; none were free. Many had been personally known to Scrooge in their lives. He had been quite familiar with one old ghost in a white waistcoat, with a monstrous iron safe attached to its ankle, who cried piteously at being unable to assist a wretched woman with an infant, whom it saw below upon a doorstep. The misery with them all was clearly, that they sought to interfere, for good, in human matters, and had lost the power forever.\\n\\nWhether these creatures faded into mist, or mist enshrouded them, he could not tell. But they and their spirit voices faded together; and the night became as it had been when he walked home.', 'The Ghost conducted him through several streets familiar to his feet; and as they went along, Scrooge looked here and there to find himself, but nowhere was he to be seen. They entered poor Bob Cratchit’s house; the dwelling he had visited before; and found the mother and the children seated round the fire.\\n\\nQuiet. Very quiet. The noisy little Cratchits were as still as statues in one corner, and sat looking up at Peter, who had a book before him. The mother and her daughters were engaged in sewing. But surely they were very quiet!\\n\\n“And he took a child, and set him in the midst of them.”\\n\\nWhere had Scrooge heard those words? He had not dreamed them. The boy must have read them out as he and the Spirit crossed the threshold. Why did he not go on?\\n\\nThe mother laid her work upon the table, and put her hand up to her face.\\n\\n“The colour hurts my eyes,” she said.\\n\\nThe colour? Ah, poor Tiny Tim!', '“Always a delicate creature, whom a breath might have withered,” said the Ghost. “But she had a large heart!”\\n\\n“So she had,” cried Scrooge. “You’re right. I will not gainsay it, Spirit. God forbid!”\\n\\n“She died a woman,” said the Ghost, “and had, as I think, children.”\\n\\n“One child,” Scrooge returned.\\n\\n“True,” said the Ghost. “Your nephew!”\\n\\nScrooge seemed uneasy in his mind, and answered briefly, “Yes.”\\n\\nAlthough they had but that moment left the school behind them, they were now in the busy thoroughfares of a city, where shadowy passengers passed and re-passed; where shadowy carts and coaches battled for the way, and all the strife and tumult of a real city were. It was made plain enough, by the dressing of the shops, that here, too, it was Christmastime again; but it was evening, and the streets were lighted up.\\n\\nThe Ghost stopped at a certain warehouse door, and asked Scrooge if he knew it.\\n\\n“Know it!” said Scrooge. “Was I apprenticed here?”']]\n",
